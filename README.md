# Link all devices

<b>Link all devices</b> is a free cross-platform application to data exchange between devices on Android, iOS (commint soon), Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms.

## Download
* *[Windows installer](https://github.com/99942Team/LAD/releases/download/main/RC.zip)*
* *[Windows portable](https://github.com/99942Team/LAD/releases/download/main/RC.zip)*
* *[Linux portable (Debian based)](https://github.com/99942Team/LAD/releases/download/main/RC.zip)*
* *[MacOS](https://github.com/99942Team/LAD/releases/download/main/RC.zip)*

## Troubleshooting 
* Windows. If the program does not start then you may need to install [Visual Studio Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). If LinkAD cannot connect to the server (the connection icon in the upper right corner turns yellow), try adding the program to the firewall exceptions.
* Linux. The distribution has only a binary file. To properly work  you may need to install:
````
sudo apt install qt5-default libqt5qml5 libqt5websockets5 qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2
